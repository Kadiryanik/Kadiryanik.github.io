							<center><h4>Who am I?</h4></center>
							<p><em>I'm Kadir<em>, I was born in 1994 in <strong>Rize</strong>. I graduated from Computer Engineering department in <strong>Karadeniz Technical University</strong> in 2018. I had started my master at the same university and same department in 2019, but I quitted beacause I had to change my city. I worked on IoT communication protocol (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/6tisch/about" target="_blank">6TiSCH</a>) and embedded systems at <a href="http://mavialp.com" target="_blank">Mavi Alp</a> between 01.2017 and 06.2020. <br/></p>

							<p>After I quitted my job at MaviAlp, I took some time for myself and started looking for a new job. During this period, I received offers from several companies, but we couldn't agree on the working terms. Some companies I received an offer from are <a href="https://www.huawei.com" target="_blank">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://www.akinrobotics.com/tr/" target="_blank">AkınRobotics</a>, <a href="https://www.ctech.com.tr/tr" target="_blank">CTech</a> and <a href="https://exentech.net/" target="_blank">Exentech</a>. I accepted the offer of AkınRobotics but I resigned after one day of work. Also Huawei's offer was pretty good. If they hadn't made an offer at the same time as AirTies, I would have accepted Huawei's offer. Finally I accepted AirTies' offer and I have worked for <a href="https://www.airties.com/" target="_blank">AirTies</a> between 09.2020 and 02.2023.</p>

							<p>While I was working AirTies, I've got several interview requests from several companies. I was politely declining these interview requests since I wasn't thinking of changing my job for some reasons. Arista was actually one of the companies I declined an interview request from. They mentioned we could do the interview now and delay the start date, and I agreed to the interview. They were very polite during the interview process. I rejected their initial offer for a few reasons but got another response that explains they could fix the relevant reasons. After some emailing, I decided to accept their offer. In this process, I informed AirTies that I could continue working if they met some conditions, but my requests were too high for AirTies since the salary difference was huge. And as a result, I've decided to part ways with AirTies and embark on new adventures with Arista. I have been working for <a href="https://www.arista.com/" target="_blank">Arista</a> as a Software Engineer Consultant since 02.2023.</p>

							<p>I enjoy learning new things about software architecture, embedded systems, network(engineering, protocols, etc.), image processing and machine learning. The programming languages I have developed something on are <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java-Script</strong>, <strong>Go</strong>. This sequencing is in accordance with my coding prefrences.<br/></p>

							<p>I'm also a <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">vim</a> lover. And yes, that needs to be a separated paragraph.<br/><br/></p>

							<p>Apart from my professional life, I like to listen music, I can play a few instruments. My daily life is often spent in front of the computer :)</p>
